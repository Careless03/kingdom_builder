<!-- <h1>Equipment</h1> -->
<h1>Kingdom Conquerers</h1>
<h2>Equipment</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Your objective is to select one of the kingdoms. From there, you will go and attempt to conquer the rest of the map.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A square 20 by 20 grid filled with hidden squares of three types—impassable terrain that you cannot enter, Plains that can be explored and built upon, and vast forest available to harvest or cultivate. Four players each begin in one corner, controlling a single unit and initially having 2 actions (with more earned by owning cities).</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> On your turn, you’ll spend actions and/or wood to conquer adjacent squares, both claimed and unclaimed. Once conquered you can either develop your territory by building cities or harvesting the forest of the land. Cities increase the amount of actions you can take on your turn. Wood from cultivating your forest are utilized to take larger and more complex action.</p>

<p><strong>Player Order:</strong> The Holy Empire (Yellow) will go first, followed by the Immortal Kingdom (Gray), Goblin Confederation (Green), and the United Tribes (Brown). The tiles owned by a respective kingdom will turn that color.</p>

<p><strong>How to Win:</p> To win the game you can either earn the highest score by the end, or you can completely destroy your enemies. No matter what, there are only 30 rounds to win.</p>
